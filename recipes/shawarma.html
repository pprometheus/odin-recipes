    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>In a glass baking dish, mix together the malt vinegar, 1/4 cup yogurt, vegetable oil, mixed spice, cardamom,
            salt and
            pepper. Place the chicken thighs into the mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator
            for at least
            4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the tahini, 1/4 cup yogurt,
            garlic,
            lemon juice, olive oil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and adjust flavors if desired.
            Cover and
            refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once. Uncover, and cook for an additional
            5 to 10
            minutes, or until chicken is browned and cooked through. Remove from the dish, and cut into slices.</li>
        <li>Place sliced chicken, tomato, onion, and lettuce onto pita breads. Roll up, and top with the tahini sauce.
